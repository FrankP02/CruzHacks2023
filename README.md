# NATE - Intelligent Companion
Need some vibes? We got you covered. Submission for CruzHacks 2023.

## Inspiration
As CS students who also love hardware, we wanted to find a way to combine the two. 

## What it does
NATE verbally answers a question that typed in the terminal.

## How we built it
We used OpenAI's Text Completion and Google's Text-To-Speech API.

## Challenges we ran into
It took us over 3 hours to get the Google Text-to-Speech API to work, mainly because of how confusing the Google Cloud site is to navigate.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Monica**: I'm proud of being able to navigate documentation to get text-to-speech to work, since it was my first time working with software like this.

## What we learned


## What's next for NATE
The possibilities are endless, but a great place to start would be to include a bigger selection of playlists.
